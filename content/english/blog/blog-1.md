## OMG Kittens
Merp (Delafuzzypantalonis) was first introduced to me as a was always left out it seemed. He was the biggest of his litter mates but not the dominate. This I think made him hang back a lot and seek attention with us people more. It also seemed to keep him from being eaten by Cyotes. He was one of the two survivors. all his siblings and mother. 

## Ergo Meow
He seemed really inteligent for a cat though I am sure most would say the same about their cats too but he would display a hyper sense of perplexity over things that were shiney and use his paws to evaluate more than I would see the other kittys do. Im sure I'm humanizing him but he seemed more inclined to being tricky with his dominate mates to get warm spots or food. He was successful at getting food and was known to hide his left overs under rugs and papper.

At times I felt neglectful because it looked like he could have been cared for in a better way with soneone who could spend time exploring his problem solving ablities because he always looked like he wanted to solve a puzzle to me. 

## Relations / Cat Nip
He grew quiker than his siblings and started getting a bit of a weight problem. He definiatley prefered couches over trees. He made a great lap blanket and was affectionate with my roomates kid which they grew together and bonded. My roomate treated Merp like her baby which is always weird to me but he seemed to love it. He was a snuggler and would always find ways to wiggle in and curl up with someone and pur loudly when discovered. Him walking out.
