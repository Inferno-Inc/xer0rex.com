    - name : One Dev Operation
      company : Freelance (Sole Proprietor) - Web and Mobile Software Consulting and
        Engineering
      duration : "April 2021 - Current"
      content : "A revival of the freelancing and volunteer work I was doing up until the end of
        2018, working on projects for friends and private clients. I also do bids on various
        platforms for a mix of short term work. Most of which are building front end elements
        in JavaScript and Twilio communication integrations, like chat, sms, and VoIP
        within web apps."

    - name : Principle Technical Support Engineer (L4)
      company : Twilio
      duration : "Dec 2018 - April 2021"
      content :
        "As a leader on the Flex Support team, I helped build our support team and trained
        them and our customers in all things relating to Twilio Flex. Initially hired
        to trailblaze development on the internal and public processes used by others
        to ramp up with Twilio’s new product, Flex. I was a lead product support engineer
        and handled customer support tickets. Our customers ranged from single developers
        to engineering teams for globally recognized companies and groups in the private
        and public sectors. The product became wildly popular with a growing customer
        base with a company  that had more than 250,000 active accounts.
        <p>
        Handling Flex tickets required a deep understanding of web development HTTPS,
        REST APIs, ReactJS, and cross-knowledge of Twilio's products which totaled about
        20 at the time. My tickets tended to relate to CRM integrations, SSO or Messaging
        and Chat that had me constantly testing our REST APIs and tracking down message
        samples through the different networks and logging systems.
        <p>
        Flex provides omni-channel communication with two prebuilt ReactJS web components.
        This made custom code a common factor that can be time-consuming to support. I
        approached this concern by building generalized code examples so to be reused
        with things like documentation or macros for other tickets. I gave ideas for leveraging
        machine learning with my support managers and helped to build public-facing tutorials
        and step-by-step instructionals with the docs team contributing to Twilio's exceptional
        self-service experience.
        <p> 
        Developers and engineers were the majority of our ticket owners requiring that
        I was up to date with current building practices and common CRMs with complex
        ones needing a screen sharing or call to guide configurations or give code assessments.
        In short I provided closure to customers through informed empathy and being their
        advocate through the stressful process of finding their solution."

    - name : Contractor - Developer - Standard Writer
      company : DigitalOcean
      duration : "Apr 2018 - May 2018"
      content : "I worked as an assistant developer for the lead editors with the goal of building
        a prototype that would win a budget for the project. The project was started using
        HUGO and I was responsible for providing aesthetic and functional customizations
        to the site and setting up a CRM. Our team's endeavor ended in success and the
        project became the beginning design and template for Digital Oceans product docs."

    - name : Software Engineer
      company : 'PushP0P <LaunchCode Incubation> '
      duration : " Jan 2018 - Mar 2018"
      content : "An aspiring team of software engineers, designers, and future leaders. Developing
        progressive web apps and information systems while building a solid network and
        professional experience."

    - name : Front End Engineer
      company : Mumba Cloud
      duration : "Aug 2016 - Feb 2017"
      content : "A member on a small SCRUM team building a cross platform UI hosted on the cloud
        for enterprise personal systems. My main responsibilities was to build using TypeScript,
        Angular 2 components to spec from design mockups. Using the same code style and
        design patterns my lead would set making sure our code looked unified. Attended
        daily scrum meetings where we could share our day and support each other.  I would
        sometimes work on the back end and had also worked on their typography guide. "

## Software Engineer 
 10 years of experience in the industry starting with website design and computer
  graphics. A vetted web developer and technical support engineer of 6 years working
  with top industry teams to diagnose and fix outstanding problems. Skilled in assessing
  concerns and modeling systems that were not directly visible as a technical support
  lead where understanding a customer’s preference for communication was critical
  to providing and meeting the customer's expectations.
  <p>
  Being on a team and volunteering with mentorships forced me to discover ways to
  share ideas with others which have helped me gain a critical eye for code examples
  and the different forms of guides and developer documentation. Seeing different
  ways that we all learn has always taught me as well, how to better my process to
  account for new dynamics. As an engineer at heart I can feel friction when pulling
  myself away from interesting problems, however investing time in developing infrastructure
  is core to making what you couldn’t know, suddenly possible.
