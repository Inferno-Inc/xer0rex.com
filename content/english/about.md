    - name : "Principal Technical Support Engineer and Developer"
      company : "Twilio, Inc"
      duration : "2018-2021"
      content: "My duties were to lead customers through Twilio's features which can be complex and not publically visible. To attend daily meetings and provide updates and critical (and constructive) feedback to my co-workers. My job priority was supporting and trailblazing Twilio's new product at the time [Flex](https://flex.twilio.com).
      <p>
      My tickets gave an eclectic range of experiences from small solo developers and start-ups to global businesses and personalized accounts. My duties were to listen and empathize with my customer's concerns and work with my team to guide our customers with implementing a solution. While helping I was to also educate the customer by shedding some light on our systems to empower them to self-service in the future.
      <p>
      Once I attained a senior support engineer position on the team I was then responsible for answering questions for those onboarding. Also assigning tickets to who I thought would be a good match for teaching our systems. 
      <p>
      My duties also included providing support to a wide range of technical issues that would come up using any of Twilio's products that had to do with Flex, an omni-communication virtualized contact center. **Also responsible for writing or updating tutorials, step by steps and updated and ensured the quality of [Flex's public-facing documentation](https://docs.twilio.com/flex)."

## Cloud Engineer 
<p>10 years of experience as a web developer and front end engineer with years of verifiable success. A practical generalist with a full-stack JavaScript toolset. As a champion of documentation and a defender of data, I know how a person's work ethic is critical to not only building but to securing and protecting our work and customers. A long-time hobby of sketching and digital art has been invaluable to my front end projects and provided a constant ingress of fresh demographics broadening my perspective. 
</p>
<p>A wisened eye for aesthetics and years of programming power my contribution to every project and is not exclusive to graphical user interfaces. Value can be seen in my notes, documentation, and code styles, and even will rehydrate a presentation. Comprehensive knowledge of platform development, enterprise architecture, agile methodologies, team cohesion, cloud services, and web-based applications power my opinions as a clever agent of change. 
</p>
<p>A unique mix of high-level technology, philosophy, and a practical mindset fuel my love to empower a person to actualize As an enthusiastic team player and child at heart my passion for empathy and goals that promote social equity shows how much community matters to me and how it is the core mechanism for what we call tech.  On the shoulders of giants, built by those who gave before. So I can see that code belongs to everyone and that community matters.
