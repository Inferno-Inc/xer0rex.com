    - name : "Principal Technical Support Engineer and Developer"
      company : "Twilio, Inc"
      duration : "2018-2021"
      content: "My duties were to lead customers through Twilio's features which can be complex and not publically visible. To attend daily meetings and provide updates and critical (and constructive) feedback to my co-workers. My job priority was supporting and trailblazing Twilio's new product at the time [Flex](https://flex.twilio.com).
      <p>
      My tickets gave an eclectic range of experiences from small solo developers and start-ups to global businesses and personalized accounts. My duties were to listen and empathize with my customer's concerns and work with my team to guide our customers with implementing a solution. While helping I was to also educate the customer by shedding some light on our systems to empower them to self-service in the future.
      <p>
      Once I attained a senior support engineer position on the team I was then responsible for answering questions for those onboarding. Also assigning tickets to who I thought would be a good match for teaching our systems. 
      <p>
      My duties also included providing support to a wide range of technical issues that would come up using any of Twilio's products that had to do with Flex, an omni-communication virtualized contact center. **Also responsible for writing or updating tutorials, step by steps and updated and ensured the quality of [Flex's public-facing documentation](https://docs.twilio.com/flex)."

## Bio 
Web Developer and programmer. I'm a generalist in practice however canonically I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer with an appreciation for good documentation. My offtime I doodle on my notes useing key words as a motif for collage-type art. I'm often found haunting online classes that have some relation to porogramming AI.
