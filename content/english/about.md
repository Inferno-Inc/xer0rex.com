## Bio 
Web developer is a hat I wear often. I am wide ranged and rounded with OOP being my focus mostly where I mostly write code in JavaScript and G as a generalist with four years on enterprise scale teams where I am able to provide valueen in positions with unclear expectations and goals. Years of experience on large enterprise and rapidly changing code bases has given me an understadning of how global teams work and how to work with and have fun with sets of eclectic teammates often decentrelized which I am known to ascend in ranks quickly to leaderhip positions.

Briefly mentioned above I am an expert in JavaScript. Working with Frameworks like ReactJS has goptten me fluent with them and have a solid understadning of Agular. I am a SCRUM fanatic and have increasingly concenring addiction to nerdcore music. 

A products documentation is a focus of mine and something I notice a lot of because I use it virtually every day. Writing good documentation has been (and still is) a challenge for me however I still am finding great value in it. I believe that the documentation a company has and the processes that it takes to make their documention accessible and of quality for their consumers shows that they care about their product and symbolizes the quality of empathy that company has for their customers. 

## Work
My most recent employment was with Cloud Communications Platform where I worked on ther documentation for Twilio's Flex and provided technical support for it's highly customizable implementations and the pother products offered by Twilio's Cloud. 

## Curently...
 
 I have been interested in Enterprise developmentprocesses and am currently working in cross-platform development to streamline deploys for mainstream mobile devices and displays and CI testing.
